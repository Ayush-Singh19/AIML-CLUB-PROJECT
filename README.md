Quantum Club Intro Project
You have been provided with a dataset containing student
performance details. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by creating a
Jupyter notebook. Analyse univariate (individual variables) bivariate
(relationships between variables), and multivariate (multiple variables)
aspects.
Share your findings and inferences about trends, patterns, or insights you
discovered through EDA.
